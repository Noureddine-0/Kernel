# Linux Kernel Modules Repository

This repository is a collection of Linux Kernel Modules (LKMs) . LKMs are pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded and unloaded into the Linux kernel. They extend the functionality of the kernel, allowing you to add features, modify behavior, or interact with the kernel in various ways.

## Overview

The LKMs in this repository serve different purposes and cater to a variety of needs. Whether you're looking to enhance system security, optimize performance, or experiment with kernel-level functionality, you'll find modules here that can assist you in achieving your goals.

## Modules

Within this repository, you'll find a range of LKMs, each designed to address specific use cases or provide unique capabilities. These modules have been created to empower Linux users and administrators with additional tools and functionality, all while maintaining compatibility with the Linux kernel.

## Prerequisites

Before using any of the LKMs in this repository, please ensure that you have access to a Linux system that meets the kernel version requirements of the modules you intend to use. Additionally, refer to each module's documentation for specific prerequisites, if any.

## Usage

Each LKM in this repository comes with its own README or documentation, providing detailed instructions on how to use and deploy the module. Be sure to follow the guidelines and recommendations provided to make the most of these kernel extensions.

## Contributing

Your contributions to this repository are welcome and encouraged. If you have ideas for new LKMs or improvements to existing ones, please consider contributing. Refer to the repository's contribution guidelines for details on how to get involved and make your mark on the world of Linux kernel development.
